üöÄ Crypto Trading Assistant Dashboard
A Django-based web application that analyzes recent cryptocurrency price movements using technical indicators like RSI, EMA, ATR, and momentum to provide trading advice, leverage suggestions, and take-profit/stop-loss levels.


üß† Features
üìä Price Tracking for multiple coins (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Ripple).

üìà RSI (Relative Strength Index): Detects overbought/oversold conditions.

üìâ EMA (Exponential Moving Average): Identifies trend direction.

üì¶ ATR (Average True Range): Used for realistic TP/SL levels based on volatility.

üß≠ Momentum Detection: Checks short-term trends (up/down/flat).

üîÆ Smart Trading Advice: Based on the combination of RSI + EMA.

‚öñÔ∏è Leverage Suggestions: Dynamically adjusts based on signal strength.

‚úÖ Built with Django class-based views and background management commands for fetching real-time data.

üèóÔ∏è How It Works
Data Fetching
A Django management command fetches crypto price data from the CoinGecko API every day/hour (depending on your plan).

Analysis
The dashboard uses technical indicators:

RSI: Over 70 = sell, below 30 = buy

EMA: If price > EMA = upward trend

ATR: Used to calculate TP and SL

Momentum: Analyzes 3-candle trend

Advice & Leverage
Based on the above, the app gives:

Trade direction: LONG / SHORT

TP & SL points

Suggested leverage (e.g., 10x, 15x) based on confidence
